# hackerearth
I am a Mechanical Engineer with some interest in computer science and programming (That's why I am here, though)!

At the time of writing this readme, I am following GITHUB guide ---> "Hello World | Github Guides". 

This repository is of my own solutions that I have successfully submitted to some of the practice questions on hackerearth || This repository is a result of my curiosity to learn about Github!

Do not copy and paste the solutions, instead try to gather some concepts, if any, from the codes.

I am in the process of documenting my code that will help me to understand my code at a later point of time.

Almost all the codes are written in C++.

HAPPY CODING!
